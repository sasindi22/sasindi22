## 🧠 About Me

I’m a full-time undergraduate software engineering student with a strong interest in logic-driven development. I enjoy building interactive, functional applications and continually push myself to explore and understand how things work under the hood. My long-term goal is to work as a Software Engineer, with future aspirations in Artificial Intelligence engineering.

Currently, I’m focused on sharpening my full stack development skills while completing my degree and working on side projects during my available time.
